- "We can relax" = "Just like before, we can relax"
- "It is useful to.. about means." = "Let's review our motives for requiring a large sample. First, a large sample would ensure that the sampling distribution of the mean was nearly normal. Second, it also gave us support that the estimate of the standard error was reliable. Both of these issues seemed to be satisfactorily addressed when the sample size was larger than 50. Now, we'll think about how these issues (the shape of the sampling distribution, and the accuracy of the standard error estimate) change under small samples."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "scores, split by" = "scores for each"
- "whether the sample difference," = "whether the observed difference in sample means,"
- "before moving forward with our methods" = ""
- should we combine Exercises 6.14, 6.15, and 6.16 ?
- "With the conditions.. the $t$ distribution." = "After verifying the conditions for each sample and confirming the samples are independent of each other, we are ready to conduct our test using the $t$ distribution."
- "can be identified using" = "can be calculated using"
- it is a bit odd to provide just part of the solution to Exercise 6.16
- "Computing the test statistic:" = "We compute the test statistic as"
- "for degrees of" = "for the degrees of"
- "The data provides" = "The data provide"


6.2.3: Two sample $t$ confidence interval
