Section 6.4: Hypothesis testing for two proportions
----------------------------------------------------
- "were assigned" = "were randomly divided"
- really fantastic opening paragraph. one of the best i've seen yet. great work
- do you want to use "survival proportion" instead of "survival rate", since the latter is already taken


Section 6.4.1: Large sample framework for a difference in two proportions
----------------------------------------------------
- "could this difference be due to chance?" = "we wonder if this observed difference could be due to chance."
- "To check.. data." = "We'd like to investigate this using a large sample framework, but we first need to check the conditions for such an approach."
- there are a few ?? in this section. maybe it just needs to be compiled again
- ".. helps or hurts." = ".. helps or hurts (remember we never "accept" the null hypothesis, we can only reject or fail to reject)."
- "Explicitly, the" = "The"
- "as the samples sizes" = "when the sample sizes"
- "to this data" = "to these data"


Section 6.4.2: Simulating a difference under the null distribution
----------------------------------------------------
- "presented here" = "presented there"
- when describing the randomization technique, i wonder if we could say something like "if the 13\% difference was due completely to chance, then the behavior of those with the blood thinner and those without should be the same. in this case, we could simulate \emph{null} differences just by mixing up the people (without regard for whether they received the treatment or not). by making a random "fake treatment" and random "fake control", we could get an idea of what a random difference might look like if the blood thinner actually had no impact." you might also mention this is sometimes called a "permutation" method
- "This simulates the null hypothesis.." may not be necessary (and may not be strictly accurate)
- "In such a case.. is reasonable." = "In such cases, more advanced methods (or a large sample approximation) would be more appropriate."

Section 6.4.3: Null distribution for the difference in two proportions
----------------------------------------------------
- "wouldn't be still exist but be less dramatic if the p-values were smaller" = huh ?
- "or computing to employ." = "or simulations."
