Section 6.3 is new. Section 6.4 will soon be added.


Section 6.3 - Hypothesis testing for a proportion - general comments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- how about calling 6.3.2 "Generating the null distribution and p-value by simulation"
- how about calling 6.3.3 "Generating the exact null distribution and p-value"


Section 6.3 - Hypothesis testing for a proportion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- "Hypothesis testing for a proportion" = "Hypothesis testing for a single proportion"
- "are also valid for large" = "will be very similar to those used for large"


Section 6.3.1 - When the success-failure condition is not met
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- i'm a little foggy on the first paragraph. here are some notes for a revision: "People in need of non-emergency surgeries sometimes seek the help of a "medical consultant"[i'm not sure what they do, but i'll pretend for now]. These consultants assist the patient in all aspect of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery. Patients often choose a consultant based on the consultants historical complication rate. One consultant tried to attract patients by noting the average complication rate for surgeries in the US is about 10\%, but she has only had 3 complications in the 62 surgeries she has facilitated. She claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefor she should be hired !)."
- in the solution to Example 6.19.. it should be clarified that there are two considerations (1) is she causing lower rates of complications and (2) is her rate lower just by chance
- in Exercise 6.20.. the value "p" is ambiguous. if i understand the problem correctly, then p := the consultants true complication rate and \hat{p} := the estimated complication rate for the consultant. if this is accurate, we might either (a) specify these earlier in this section or (b) ask a warm-up exercise that leads the reader to generate these
- in Example 6.21.. "why the normal approximation should not be applied to the point estimate" is a little unclear. perhaps we are saying "why the normal approximation is not appropriate for conducting inference about p in this case"
- in the solution to Example 6.21.. it might be preferable to enumerate and check each condition distinctly. eg "(i) independence - the independence condition may be reasonable.." "(ii) success-failure - the success failure condition.."
- "The normal approximation.. 0.048." = "The normal approximation cannot safely be applied to inference about the parameter p - the consultants true complication rate."
- "To do so, we need a p-value." = "To do so, we need to evaluate the possibility of a sample value (\hat{p}) this far (.10 - .048 = .052) or further from the claim (p_o). This possibility is usually measure with a p-value."
- "If given" = "If, given"
- i see. i thought "If given.." was a fragment sentence. how about "Given the null distribution,.."
- or better yet "Given the sampling distribution assuming a true null hypothesis,.."
- after the title of this section, the content was a bit of a surprise. perhaps something like "
- the title of this section didn't prepare me for the content


Section 6.3.2 - Simulating to get the null distribution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- "hypothesis as true" = "hypothesis were true"
- "alone and use" = "alone. Then we will use"
- have you told us yet that we are discussing "liver donors"
- "simulation, and there" = "simulation. There were"
- Example 6.22. great !
- "see the null distribution" = "see a distribution of many \hat{p}_{sim} (ie. the sampling distribution)"; also "single" = "\emph{single}"; then "More simulations are necessary." = ""
- "That is, the" = "The"


Section 6.3.3 - Generating the null distribution using the binomial model
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- "P(k successes) = "P(K successes in n cases)"
- "where the result provides at least as strong of evidence as the data in that direction".. i'm not sure on the best wording here. perhaps the something like the classic "results this extreme or more so"
- "to check for association between the consultant's business and lower complication rates" = "to check the consultants claim that her complication rate is below 10\%"
- "consultant, and under the null hypothesis, p = 0.10" = "consultant. Since we are testing against the 10\% national average, our null hypothesis is p = 0.10"; (why aren't we using "p_o" here ?)
