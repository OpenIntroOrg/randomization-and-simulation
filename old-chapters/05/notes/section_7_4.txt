7.4 Inference for linear regression
------------------------------------------------------------
- "by reading output from" = "using"


7.4.1 Midterm elections and unemployment
------------------------------------------------------------
- "Every four.. party will do." = "Elections for members of the United States House of Representatives occur every two years, coinciding every four years with the U.S. Presidential election. The set of House elections occurring during the middle of a Presidential term are called "mid-term" elections, and are thought to be closely linked with unemployment. In America's two-party system, political theory suggests the higher the unemployment rate, the worse the President's party will do in the midterm elections."
- "shows this data" = "shows these data"
- "for president's party" = "for President's party"
- we should be clear about whether these include the 2010 midterms
- i believe "President" should be capitalized throughout
- "1939) was removed" = "1939 were removed"
- "because in both cases the unemployment rate was 21\% and 18\%." = "because the unemployment rate was 21\% and 18\% respectively."
- "1989 against the" = "1989 plotted against the"
- it might be better to do a two-sided alternative here


7.4.2 Reading and understanding software output for regression
------------------------------------------------------------
- "Reading and understanding software output for regression" = "Understanding regression output from software"
- ".. $\hat{b}_1$. Using this.. have before." = ".. $\hat{b}_1$ and compute a test statistic."
- "We will label the test statistic using a t since it will follow the t distribution." = "We generally label the test statistic with a t, since it follows the t distribution."
- "shows the software" = "shows software"
- "as unemp" = "unemp"
- "the data does not" = "the data do not"
- caption for Figure 7.19.. do we want to mention this is the "sampling distribution"
- "we can see that the same hypothesis test was used to compute the p-value" = "we can see we also used a null hypothesis of 0 to compute the p-value"
- "then these methods presented" = "then the methods presented"
- "which relates the freshman" = "which relates freshman"
- "you the slope" = "you that the slope"
- "if we formally set up a hypothesis test, do you think the test would reject the notion that the true slope" = "do you think a formal hypothesis test would reject the claim that the true slope"
- "shows the statistical" = "shows statistical"


7.4.3 An alternative test statistic*
------------------------------------------------------------
- "then it the" = "then the"
- "statistical methods." = "statistical techniques."
