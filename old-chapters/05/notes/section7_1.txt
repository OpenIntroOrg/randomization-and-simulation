Section 7.1.1: Scatterplots of paired data
----------------------------------------------------
- "When the data... useful" move this sentence to the next paragraph. then frame that paragraph as a disclaimer. we consider straight lines in this section and curvy lines in the next section. by the way, why is this information not arranged with the previous section talking about Figure 7.3. disclaim once, early on, and you should be set
- can we move away form using "tube" which is a three dimensional notion and switch to "path"


Section 7.1.2: Fitting a line
----------------------------------------------------
- "That is... some amount" = "Linear models can be used for predicting values of Y by taking the average value of Y predicted for a particular X based on the model." this concept needs an image


Section 7.2.2: Conditions for the least squares line
----------------------------------------------------
- "Nearly normal residuals". we have not yet been clear about what we mean by normality in residuals. for example, what should the mean be ? we should probably include one of those images that has a line with a bunch of normal curves superimposed


Section 7.2.3: Finding the least squares line
----------------------------------------------------
- "We need to find values, b_0 and b_1 that match the least squares line". (1) this is not correct. b_0 and b_1 are numbers, and cannot "match" a line. (2) this sentence touches upon an interesting point: what are we really asking of b_0 and b_1 ? are we simply looking for those that minimize the loss criterion or are we search for the "truth". i need to think about this. perhaps we can discuss it when we speak next
- "These two values... regression line." Which two are the parameters ? b_0 and b_1 ? or the things they match ?


Section 7.2.5: Using R^2 to describe the strength of a fit
----------------------------------------------------
- use "SAT-GPA" in previous sections instead of the longer handles currently in the text


Section 7.3: Types of outliers in linear regression
----------------------------------------------------
- can we label Figure 7.16, and others like it, using eg a, b, c, d, e, f ?
- then "cases (3), (4), and (5)" gets letters instead and becomes less ambiguous
- is the outlier in 7.17 (a) a high leverage point ?
- can we use more dramatic examples for 7.17 (b) and (c) ?
- can we use only one of 7.16 and 7.17, likely dropping 7.17 ?
- what other "types of outliers" will be considered in this section ?
