7: Introduction to linear regression
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "news, where.. scatterplots." = ""
- "there is a linear relationship" = "there is a relationship"
- "Usually we.. $b_1$." = "Usually, we use $b_0$ and $b_1$ to denote the point estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$."
- in Figure 7.1 "Quoted cost (dollars)" = "Total cost of the shares (dollars)"
- "and the cost quotes were reported" = "and the total cost of the shares was reported"
- "This data is from" = "These data are from"


7.1: Line fitting, residuals, and correlation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- good


7.1.1: Beginning with straight lines
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "If data shows" = "If the data show"
- "Such an estimate.. good on the average." = ""
- it might be helpful, in this subsection, to emphasize a little more that the line drawn by eye is not "ideal". we might want to prime them by saying it would be helpful to have a more rigorous method. then we can tell them we will evaluate possible lines visually using the residual plots of the next section. we can hint that residuals might be a focus for fitting in a more structured way


7.1.3: Residuals
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- do we use the absolute value of the residuals later ? if not, "The size.. is larger than |-1|." = ""
- "We often plot them" = "We often display them"
- "model this data" = "model these data"
- "data but should use a more advanced technique." = "data, and should use a more advanced technique instead."
- "We will tackle this" = "We will address this"


7.1.4: Describing linear relationships with correlation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- good


7.2: Fitting a line by least squares regression
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "we define.. {\em least squares regression}." = "we proposed {\em least squares regression} as a more rigorous approach."
- "for a random" = "from a random"


7.2.1: An objective measure for finding the best line
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- very good


7.2.2: Conditions for the least squares line
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- very good


7.2.3: Finding the least squares line
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "around the line gets larger" = "around the line increases"
- "to get familiar with" = "to become more familiar with"
- "zero or to create" = "zero, and to create"
- "the third column are $t$ statistics" = "the third column contains $t$ statistics"


7.2.4: Interpreting regression line parameter estimates
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "describes what the average" = "describes the average"
- "on the average" = "on average"
- "We can also.. one unit larger" = ""


7.2.5: Extrapolation is treacherous
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "variables, and these" = "variables. However, these"
- excellent work on this section


7.2.6: Using $R^2$ to describe the strength of a fit
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "the data clusters" = "the data cluster"
- good job


7.3: Types of outliers in linear regression
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "plot pair , identify" = "plot pair, identify"
- "outlier was influential on the slope of the" = "outlier influenced the slope"
- "trend was assigned" = "trend were assigned"


7.4: Inference for linear regression
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "However, we will" = "However, in the case of regression, we will"


7.4.1: Midterm elections and unemployment
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "the the best linear model" = "that the true linear model"  (this is a tricky edit, because "true" implies a linear model is correct, when actually, "best" is more sound philosophically. i propose the change for pedagogical reasons. of course, i am happy to discuss this or simply yield to your expertise)
- "does the data" = "do the data"
- "best" would be changed in the hypotheses as well if the earlier edit is adopted
- "if the data provides" = "if the data provide"


7.4.2: Understanding regression output from software
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "corresponds with a greater" = "corresponds to a greater"
- "T (Z)" = "T (or Z)"
- "correspond with larger" = "correspond to larger"


7.4.3: An alternative test statistic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "Here we consider a new value: $R^2$." = "However, we could focus on $R^2$."
