- "student, but there" = "student. However, there"
- "be a lot of variability, even" = "be variability in financial support, even"
- "Data rarely fit.. perfectly" = "A model rarely fits data perfectly"
- "In each case.. exactly on the line." = "In these examples the data fall near, but not exactly on, the straight line."
