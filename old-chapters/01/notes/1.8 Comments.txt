"the difference of 29.2\% the researchers observed would be" = "the observed difference of 29.2\% was"
"Consider the alternative: ... decision. If this is true, we would expect" = "Consider the alternative model: bankers were influenced by which gender was listed on the personnel file. If this was true, and especially if this difference was large, we would expect"
"females, with a lower ... female." = "females. If this gender bias was against females, we would expect a smaller fraction of promotion decisions for female personnel files relative to the male files."
"males and females" = "male and female candidates" (this is just before the previous edit)

"difference would have been due to chance" = "difference was due to chance"
"the files would not have impacted" = "the files did not impact"
"We are going to recreate ... Table 1.44." [two paragraphs, replaced by two paragraphs] = "Table~\ref{discriminationResults} shows that 35 banker supervisors recommended promotion and 13 did not. Now, imagine we could have a do-over where the bank supervisors forget they've already done this little exercise and repeat the study. Then, if the supervisors' decisions truly were made without regard to gender, each will make the same decision again regardless of the gender indicated on the personnel file they receive. Suppose the researchers shuffle the personnel files again, but they shuffle differently. When they hand these files out to the 48 supervisors, the same 35 supervisors as before will elect to promote the candidate and other 13 will not, regardless of the gender listed on any file. In this imaginary do-over where we know there to be no discrimination, any observed difference between the promotion rates for males and females would be entirely due to chance.

While we cannot erase memories, we can create \term{simulate} what would happen in such a scenario. In this \term{simulation}, we thoroughly shuffle 48 personnel files, 24 labeled \resp{maleSim} and 24 labeled \resp{femaleSim}, and deal these files into two stacks representing \resp{promoted} and \resp{not promoted}. The \resp{promoted} stack will have 35 files and the \resp{no promoted} stack 13 to represent the bankers in the study. Then, as we did with the original data, we tabulate the fraction of \resp{maleSim} and \resp{femaleSim} that were promoted. Any difference in the two fractions is entirely due to chance. Table~\ref{discriminationRand1} show the results of such a simulation."
"groups? Answer in the footnote" = "study? Answers in the footnote" (two words are changed)

"chance. We could repeat the simulation to get another difference from chance:" = "chance by physically shuffling and dealing out files. However, this type of simulation can also be run on a computer in a fraction of a second. Repeating the simulation on a computer, we get another difference due to chance:" (computer bit added due to previous note about it eliminated)
"were deem end" = "were deemed"
"one-hundred" (figure caption) = "100"
"of at least 29.2\%." (figure caption) = "of at least 29.2\%, the difference observed in the study."
"are centered" = "is centered"
"the null hypothesis, the independence model, was true. ... indicating the opposite." = "the independence model was true, and under this condition, we expect the difference to be zero with some random fluctation. We would generally be surprised to see a difference of \emph{exactly} 0: sometimes, just by chance, the difference is higher than 0, and other times it is the opposite."
I adjusted Figure 1.45 since the dot stacks had different horizontal distances between the stacks. I actually had trouble getting the dotPlot function from either the BHH2 or the qualityTools package to produce a good plot (the qualityTools plot was accurate, but it generated two plots in the PDF), so I just created the plot manually. I also adjusted the plotting dimensions so that the figure text would be about equal in size to other text on the page.
"being unfairly discriminated" = "being discriminated"
"rare event, hence reject the null ... in promotion decisions." = "Based on the simulations, we have two options. (1) We conclude that the study results do not provide strong evidence against the independence model. That is, we do not have sufficiently strong evidence to conclude there was gender discrimination. (2) We conclude that the results are sufficiently strong to reject $H_0$ and conclude that there was gender discrimination. When we conduct formal studies, usually we reject the notion that we just happened to observe a rare event\footnote{This reasoning does not generally extend to anecdotal observations. Each of us observes incredibly rare events every day, events we could not possibly hope to predict. However, in the non-rigorous setting of anecdotal evidence, almost anything may seem a rare event, so the idea of looking for rare events in day-to-day activities is treacherous. For example, we might look at the lottery: there was only a 1 in 176 million chance that the Mega Millions numbers for the largest jackpot in history (March 30, 2012) would be (2, 4, 23, 38, 46) with a Mega ball of (23), but nonetheless those numbers came up! However, no matter what numbers had turned up, they would have had the same incredibly rare odds. That is, \emph{any set of numbers we could have observed would ultimately be incredibly rare}. This type of situation is typical of our daily lives: each possible event in itself seems incredibly rare, but if we consider every alternative, those outcomes are also incredibly rare. We should be cautious not to misinterpret such anecdotal evidence.}. So in this case, we reject the independence model in favor of the alternative. That is, we are concluding the data provide strong evidence of gender discrimination against women by the supervisors."
"Errors do occur --" = "Errors do occur, just like rare events, and"
