Section 1.7: Three sampling methods
----------------------------------------------------
- "Statistical methods rely on understanding randomness." = "Almost all statistical methods are based on the notion that samples are random."
- perhaps in the first paragraph, we might distinguish between random samples and non-random samples. "In this section, and hopefully throughout your experience with statistics, we'll be concerned with \emph{random samples}, as opposed to \emph{non-random samples} \footnote{The most common non-random sampling technique is \emph{convenience sampling}, where a person simple chooses their sample based on whatever is easiest to gather.}" you might also include an example that draws out the faults of non-random sampling
- "The most.. Section 1.5." = "\emph{Simple random sampling}, which was first introduced in Section 1.5, is probably the most intuitive form of random sampling."
- "drop the balls" = "drop the ping pong balls"
- move "the singular of strata is stratum" to a footnote and use the "- .. -" to describe how strata are decided eg "usually subgroups with similar characteristics"
- "(such as simple random sampling)" goes here "sampling method (here) is employed"
- it might be useful to start the baseball example with a particular sample size in mind, perhaps 120. then mention you are drawing 120 names in the ping pong example
- if you wanted to toss in a joke you could say "some teams have much more money (we're looking at you Yankees)" or something like this (perhaps as a footnote)
- "analyzing the data" = "analyzing data"
- "methods introduced in this book cannot be used." = "introduced in this book would need to be extended."
- your answer in Example 1.49 is actually different from what i would have thought. my understanding in stratified random sampling was that we are interested in developing a sampling that is sure to get information about each subgroup (in an efficient fashion), and that we continue to be primarily interested in the general population. i'm not sure i am (more) correct, but i thought i'd toss in my two cents
- "and then collect" = "and collect"
- careful with the work "convenience". "Statisticians usually employ a cluster sample out of convenience." = "Sometimes cluster sampling can be a more economic random sampling technique than alternatives."
- regarding Example 1.50, how about using one about villages instead or or in addition to. for example, "Suppose we are interested in estimating the malaria rate in a densely tropical portion of rural Indonesia. We believe there are 30 villages in that part of the Indonesian jungle, each more or less similar to the next. Our goal is to test 150 individuals for malaria. In this case, a simple random sample would likely draw individuals from all 30 villages, which could make data collection extremely expensive. Stratified sampling would be a challenge since it is unclear how we would build homogeneous stratum. However, cluster sampling seems like a very good idea. First, we might randomly select half the villages, then randomly select 10 people from each. This would probably reduce our data collection costs substantially in comparison to a simple random sample, and would still give us reliable information." Then follow up with an exercise. for example, "Cluster sampling is more convenient than simple random sampling in this example, but it is absolutely \emph{not} a \emph{convenience sample}. Explain what a convenience sample might be in this case, and how that wouldn't be a statistically sounds as a cluster sample."
- great work on the graphical representation of sampling schemes. only one comment, some red circles grab more than one dot. one thought might be to use black dots for those chose (in addition to red circles) and gray dots for those not chose. it is a small point
