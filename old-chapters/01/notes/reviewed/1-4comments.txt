Scatterplots for paired data
--------------------------------------------------------
- "In any scatterplot, each point represents a single observation". my favorite
variety of leading phrase

Association
--------------------------------------------------------
- "Associated" box... Title = "Associated or independent, not both". in general try
to make the titles of these boxes more informative

Dot plots and the mean
--------------------------------------------------------
- "In these cases". my favorite use of a leading phrase
- well done introducing the mean along with dotplots

Histograms and shape
--------------------------------------------------------
- a definition of binning would be helpful between "...useful to bin the data" and
"For example,"

Variance and standard deviation
--------------------------------------------------------
- in steps of variance. use semi colons or list them vertically
- i might present the utility of the standard deviation as three numbered parts,
possible more. (1) relaxed measure of spread (2) chebyschev (3) also identifying
skew in zero bounded variables with mean less than one or two standard deviations
from zero. perhaps we can discuss this point in real time
- abstract exclusively to the standard deviation after introducing the variance and
defining s = s^2. in other words, don't mention the variance so heavily later on
- maybe roll the "used to compute... population mean" into a fourth bullet point for
the standard deviation. these are great opportunities to foreshadow

Box plot, quartiles and the median
--------------------------------------------------------
- consider adding a step-by-step or extended box with the precise manual
construction of a box plot. this is an interesting point... do we want to include
manual calculations in the body of the text, or create technical appendices at the
end of each chapter giving the manual details... the latter might be more consistent
with the pedagogy of statistics moving away from hand done procedures
- now that i think about it... some parallels could be drawn between manual and
computational appendices
- "Following the box,... either direction". split into two sentences. exchange
phrase "following the box" for something more descriptive such as "extending out
from the box" [This paragraph was updated but this paragraph should be reread.]
- excellent definition of outliers

More on outliers
--------------------------------------------------------
- i like the tip boxes. should we consider using different colors for tip boxes
versus definition boxes. we should be sensitive to the possibility that students may
print only in black and white

Robust estimates
--------------------------------------------------------
- consider using a dotplot to explain this concept as well

Density plots
--------------------------------------------------------
- "The density plot... smoothed histogram" seems correct to me. "smooth version of
the frequency of the data" or "smooth version of the intensity of the data" are also
correct. "smoothed version of the data" seems like the least correct
- "to a histogram: locations" = "to a histogram. Locations"
- use of the word "positive" needs to be clarified here
- a second example, where it does not make sense for positive density above a
positive threshold could be interesting
- paragraph "The downside... " would be helped by a discussion of kernel bandwidths,
which is probably too advanced for this subsection. this might be another reason to
move this section
- exercise "Do you have boundary..." is probably too subtle given the tools provided
