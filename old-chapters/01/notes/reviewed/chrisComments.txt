General comments
---------------------------------------------------------------
- avoid muddying synonyms (e.g. "recorded (written down)", "measurements or
information", "answer (guess)")
- Avoid two consecutive paragraphs beginning with "In practice"
- avoid parenthetic remarks
- please try to avoid beginning a sentence with a prepositional phrase
(eg. "In any data frame, each")
- "The cars data set is a sample" = "The cars data set represents a
sample". you tend to say "A" is "B" when really "A" is related to "B". often the relationship is general such as "represents"
- also, try to avoid the word "got". informal, and sloppy
- "In any scatterplot, each point represents a single observation". my favorite variety of leading phrase
- "Associated" box... Title = "Associated or independent, not both". in general try to make the titles of these boxes more informative
- "In these cases". my favorite use of a leading phrase
- in steps of variance. use semi colons or list them vertically
