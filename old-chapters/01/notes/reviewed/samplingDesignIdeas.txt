*** Stratified
  * Can be useful if we know characteristics of the population
  * If subpopulations vary greatly, then stratified sampling is powerful
  - Small sample from a population (boys/girls)
  - Consider the amount of rain for a geographic region
  - Sampling the number of plants per square meter in a crater (circular strata!)
  - Burn area for a geographic area
  - Number of trees per acre (or size of trees) in a national park


*** Cluster examples
  * Reduces cost in many cases
  * Estimates tend to be less precise than SRS or stratified
  - Trees in the national park
  - In-person surveys
