Things to look at:

* Introduction to Chapter 1 (all)

* Section 1.1 (all)

* Both the cars and possum data sets are introduced in 1.2. It may be worth skimming Section 2 to see if you think the current layout is confusing.

* Intro to Section 1.3. The population mean and standard deviation are described in this section, so this is why the sample/population definitions are here. Any idea on a more elegant strategy?

* The introduction to the histogram in the first paragraph of Section 1.3.3 does not seem optimal. I'm not sure if this paragraph needs some modification. What do you think?

* Margin note format on pages 13, 14, 17, and 18 okay?

* Comments on the last paragraph of Section 1.3.3 would be helpful. The word "casually" doesn't seem to fit very well. Suggestions?

* Page 18: "Computing the variance and standard deviation for a population uses the same formulas and methods as for a sample." Technically this is not accurate but it is incredibly close when the population is large (as it typically is). For populations, we divide by n instead of n-1 for variance. How should this be modified? I basically would like this information hidden from the reader but it to be technically accurate. I considered a footnote, which may be an ultimate solution here.

* Read introduction to Section 1.5, 1.5.1, and 1.5.2.

* Reread Example 1.7 (p42), especially the solution.

* If you haven't previously read it, could you read over 1.6?
