absolutely. at some point i will spend time doing better
formatting for the boxes... i've just been lazy on doing
this. also, all colors/figures are made with the expectation
they will be printed black/white. even if there are two or
more colors, they are varying shades and so should still be
distinguishable if printed in B&W. this is especially
important considering your note that i use red/green a fair
amount (which i'll now avoid when possible).

i think this is a good motivator for students. i expect it
will prompt them to ask more interesting questions about
the data if these relationships are highlighted. i have no
basis other than my inclination to include it early on so
we can discuss a change.

this would be useful and worth discussing more. i think chebyshev
is only worth mentioning in passing but i like (1), (3), and (4).

i've toned it down a bit but not to the traditional level.
i want a slightly stronger introduction to variance to setup
students to be more comfortable with examining variances of
a*X+b*Y, etc, where the standard deviation is more
complicated to handle. we can even have exercises for
students to show that the variance of a mean is the original
variance over n, foreshadowing one component of the central
limit theorem (i haven't yet done this). i also haven't even
written a subsection on determining Var(a*X+b*Y) for the
10 week course release but it would be added for a 15 week
course release.

+ binning

i think "For example..." clears up what binning means. can you
take a second look? if you still disagree i'll put something in.

+ paragraph on fences

could you review the revised paragraph? it starts with
"Extending out from the box"

step-by-step approaches were something rob said was a classical
textbook approach that is being moved away from. this may be an
exception but i'm not yet convinced. i don't think it is
important for students to be able to construct a box plot by
hand but i think it is important that they answer specific
questions about the box plot. i could add some exercises that
prompt the student to consider each part of the box plot (e.g.
what is the 75th percentile? why doesn't the fence extend to
the maximum? etc.). would these questions be a good fix to
your concern?

i'm not sure either. it does tie in with explanatory/response
and would be nice to talk about earlier for greater discussion.
what holds me back from making the effort to push it earlier is
that none of the other sections would benefit from it. there are
no human studies or experimental data in the earlier sections
where it would be useful to have this information. do you see
this as a major problem that should be addressed or is it
reasonable to have it stand in as 1.5?

i'm going to redo some of this. i want to introduce a case
where there is no reason to suspect causation. then i will
introduce another pair of variables where the student would
want to say an association means causation (maybe education
and income). then i will make the case that we only would
want to draw a causal conclusion in the second example because
of our preconception, however, data doesn't in any way have to
reflect our preconceptions. i'll push into the idea that it is
silly to pick/choose where we make causation conclusions. from
here i will frame up an experiment as a means to make causal
conclusions (similar to what currently exists).

+ omission of sampling types
> the omission of sampling types (eg. simple random,
> stratified) is conspicuous
i think this is best put in a (much) later chapter of
experimental design. rob didn't seem to think this material
was appropriate so early on. i would guess because students
would not understand the purpose/motivation for stratifying
or clustering and/or why it matters. so, i say we hold off
until the student would find it useful to know this info.

+ omission of blocking
> the omission of blocking is conspicuous
same as above.

+ importance of randomization
> the importance of randomization in experiments is a little
> undersold
i'm hoping it was stressed enough in earlier sections. if you
have time to glance back and look at 1.2, let me know if you
think it was not enough. if not, i'll try to add more
throughout the chapter.
