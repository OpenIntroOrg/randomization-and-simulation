# probably remove

.. 2-3 data sets will be introduced, as needed
* Information overload
  . data
  - observations, variables, and possums
    .. introduce data as a data frame
    . observation
    . variable
  - how are variables related?
    . explanatory / independent
    . response / dependent
    .. use dot plot even though it is not formally introduced
  - conclusions from samples
    . sample
    . population
  - bias, error, and uncertainty
    . bias
    . convenience sample
      .. website survey
    . measurement error
      .. e.g. earthquake locations
    #. systematic bias
    . random sample (as a the solution)
    . sample variability
* Collecting and examining information
  . data: "observations that are recorded in some format"
  - two sample data sets
    . observation
    . variable
  - a sample versus the population
  - investigating variable relationships
    . explanatory / independent
    . response / dependent
    .. use scatterplot even though it's formally introduced later
  - how was the data collected?
  - bias or error in data
* Data format
  - data frame
    . row: obs
    . col: variable
    . independence
      .. discuss for both variables and observations
  - variable types
    . numerical / quantitative
      . continuous
      . discrete
    . categorical / qualitative
    . ordinal
  - coding data
    . disjoint / mutually exclusive
    . levels (of a factor variable)
    . binary data
  - contingency tables
    .. reporting data as counts
  - loading data into R
    .. basic installation directions
    .. provide code to load book data sets
    .. provide online resources
* Examining numerical data
  - scatterplots for paired data
    . association
    . explanatory variable
    . response variable
    . lurking variables
      .. discuss making conclusions
  - dot plots for single variables
  - histograms for single variables
    . data distribution
    . symmetric / skewed
    . mode / modality
  - numerical summaries
    . 5 number summary
      . min, Q1, median, Q3, max
    . range
    . mean & sd
    . robust statistics
    . correlation
    .. insert the phrase 'summary statistics' in subsection
    .. provide online resource for basic numerical stats in R
  - box plot
    . outlier
      .. discuss def + less formal discussion
  - density and violin plots
    . density estimates
    . violin plot
* Exploring categorical data
  - tables and plots for 1 variable
    . contingency table of counts
    . bar plot
    . proportions
    . contingency of proportions
    . pie charts (create alternative: 1-D mosaic)
  - expansion to 2 variables
    . 2 variable contingency tables
    . stacked bar plot
    .. discuss independence
    . mosaic plot
  .. provide resource for making contingency tables in R
  .. also provide online resource with lots of sample code
* Exploratory data analysis
  - comparing data across groups
    .. alternatively, 'side-by-side plots'
    . side-by-side box plots
    . side-by-side violin plots
  - Introduction to EDA in R
    . edaPlot (prototype built)
      .. leads into other plotting functions
      .. need to add functionality to edaPlot to adjust data type
    .. formally introduce hist(x) and mosaicplot(table)
* Observational studies and experiments
  - data collection procedure
    . observational study
    . experiment
      .. use an example data set
    . principles of experimental design
      . control
      . randomize
      . replicate
    .. discuss causation
  - experimental procedure
  - hypothesis testing
    . treatment
  - systematic bias
    . placebo
    . blind / double blind
  - flaws of observational studies
* Data collection procedures
  .. or maybe call this "Sampling procedures"
  - randomization
    .. focus on eliminating bias
  - simple random sampling
  - additional sampling procedures
    . stratified sampling
    . cluster sampling
  - surveys and response rate
