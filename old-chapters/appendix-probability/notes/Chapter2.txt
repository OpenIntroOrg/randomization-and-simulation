- can "2.3.5 Independence considerations" be more informative ?


2: Probability (special topic)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "people have encountered." = "people have seen before."


2.1: Defining probability (special topic)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- in the opening examples, should we mention that roles are independent ?


2.1.1: Probability
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- why do we switch from the set notation of outcomes (used in chapter 1) to the arrow notation ?
- "inclusively" ?= "inclusive"
- "random but may only be too difficult to understand." = "random; they may just be too difficult to understand exactly."


2.1.2: Disjoint or mutually exclusive outcomes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- the caption for Figure 2.2 includes a question. do we want to provide the answer in the footnote ?


2.1.3: Probabilities when events are not disjoint
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "random card is a diamond" = "randomly selected card is a diamond"
- "be in the left circle.. right" = "be in the part of the left circle that is not in the right circle"
- "event a randomly" = "event that a randomly"
- "We correct.. term:" = "We must remove one of the duplicated counts:"
- "write {\em or} in statistics" = "write ``{\em or}" in statistics"
- "mean {\em and/or} unless" = "mean ``{\em and/or}" unless"
- "If $A$ and $B$.. Why?" = "Describe why, if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $P(A \& B) = 0$."


2.1.4: Probability distributions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "the total is" = "the total is written as"
- the example about grocery bills can probably be omitted


2.1.5: Complement of an event
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "We often use.. not occur." = "The sample space is useful when considering an event and its complement; if $A^c$ is the complement of $A$, then $A^c$ is everything in the sample space except $A$."
- in Exercise 2.26, should we switch the order of (b) and (c) ?


2.1.6: Independence
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "processes can be independent." = "processes can be independent too."
- "together and so are not" = "together, so they are not"
- "is pretty basic" = "is as follows"
- in Example 2.32 "Answers to each part are in the footnote." can be moved to the end of the example
- "is, Are the" = "is, are the"


2.2: Continuous distributions (special topic)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- in Example 2.34, we could ask them to explain why having a small sample size and many bins could lead to the bin heights being volatile
- "probability a randomly" = "probability that a randomly"
- "In this case, this" = "This"
- following "This fraction is.. cm.", it might be nice to point to a later example, e.g. from a normal distribution section


2.2.1: From histograms to continuous distributions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- good


2.2.2: Probabilities from continuous distributions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "as a proportion" = "as a fraction"
- "Similarly, we use" = "Similarly, we can use"
- "will be {\tt 180 cm}" = "will be approximately {\tt 180 cm}"


2.3: Conditional probability (special topic)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- good


2.3.1: Marginal and joint probabilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- in calculations just above Exercise 2.43, use "\&" instead of ","
- in Exercise 2.43, the question is a little bit confusing since {\tt parents} is defined as "either parent used". also we are using $S$ for sample space, making {\tt S} a bit similar. perhaps drop this exercise ?


2.3.2: Defining conditional probability
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "to exploit associations" = "to use information about associations"
- "drugs and look" = "drugs, and look"
- "we know to be.. or event." = "we take to be true during the calculation."
- "used as a fraction:" = "used:"
- "available, and we use" = "available; we used"
- "one the facing page" = ""
- in these examples, perhaps use {\tt T} for student, and remark that we don't want to confuse it with $S$
- in Exercise 2.49, move "Answer for part (c) is in the footnote" to the end of part (c)
- "that drug use between parents and children tends to be associated." = "that there tends to be an association between drug use in parents, and drug use in students."


2.3.3: Smallpox in Boston, 1721
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- throughout, i'm on the fence about "probability a" ?= "probability a"; also, "probability an" = "probability that an"


2.3.4: General multiplication rule
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "Suppose we only knew" = "Suppose we knew"
- throughout, should we use a symbol within Examples to indicate when the question has ended and the answer begins ?
- "Of the 96.08" = "Among the 96.08"
- "Rule, and we can" = "Rule. We can"
- "Verify your answer in Table 2.22." = "Verify your answer using Table 2.22."


2.3.5: Independence considerations
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "should have no influence on the" = "should provide no information about the"
- "If $X$ was known to be" = "When $X$ was conditioned to be"


2.3.6: Tree diagrams
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- would you like to swap Figure 2.23 and others in this section for the updated tree structure ?
- "with the primary branching" = "with the primary branches"
- in the calculations for the midterm and final example, it might be preferable to maintain the order in P(final = A & midterm = A) for each calculation. it switches following the line "Then we take.."


2.3.7: Bayes' Theorem
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "it is also difficult to implement without many mathematical and computational techniques that we will" = "we won't have time to cover much more during this book."


2.4: Sampling from a small population (special topic)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- excellent


2.5: Random variables (special topic)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- it is a little confusing that you discuss many students in this section, but then focus on one student in the next. among other things, this means $x_i$ refers to the possible expenditures on different materials for a single student, as opposed to the possible expenditures on a single material across different students


2.5.1: Expectation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "represent its outcome by $X$." = "represent it by $X$."
- do we require that random variables be numerical ?  perhaps we could say "A process or variable, for which the outcome is initially unknown and random."
- "letter with subscripts" = "letter and subscripts"
- "and so we could write it as" = "which we could write as"


2.5.2: Variability in random variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "What else.. to generate." = ""


2.5.3: Linear combinations of random variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "commuting each week to work can" = "commuting to work each week can"
- in Example 2.83, would you like to use $W$ to be his commute time for the entire week ?
- "source of the randomness" = "source of randomness"
- "It is given that" = "We were told that"
- "make/spend" = "make or spend"
- "average of the total in a linear" = "average of a linear"
- "For examples of non-linear combinations of random variables -- .. -- see the footnote." = "A few examples of non-linear combinations of random variables -- .. -- are provided in the footnote."


2.5.4: Variability in linear combinations of random variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "standard deviation once again to" = "standard deviation to"
- "not rely.. regular basis." = "not expect this income to be vary stable."
- "of the outcome in a linear" = "of a linear"
- "so long as" = "as long as"
- "associated the TV" = "associated with the TV"
- "the variability estimate of" = "the variability computed for"
