Section 2.2: Continuous distributions
----------------------------------------------------
- "The heights... more bins" = "Figure 2.5 shows a few different histograms for heights of 3 million US adults from the mid-90's. How does changing the number of bins allow you to make different interpretations of the data ?"
- ", which can be very useful" = ""
- "It should be noted... 3 million". begin with this point. "We would like to have enough observations in each bin that the heights are not determined by a few, potentially anomalous, values." create a contrast. more bins = more detail. less bins = less spurious shape. this is a nice chance to prime the "bias-variance" discussion if we want
- in both example 2.7 and 2.8 the opening sentence is too clinical and journal-esque
- "A person... 6'11''?" = "What proportion of the sample has heights between 180 and 185 ()"
- it might be useful to include an example with few observations, so we can see the "noise" observable when using many bins. we could then ask a question "Do we really think there are twice as many people between 165 and 170 as 160 and 165 ?". this would be with the same data, just fewer values
- great job on the blue histograms. very sharp
- do we already have a loose definition of histograms elsewhere ? if not, we should add a "histogram box"
- including y-axes in Figure 2.5 might be useful

Section 2.2.1: From histograms to continuous distributions
----------------------------------------------------
- "In Section 2.1... as height" = ""
- "In general,... small)" = ""
- this opening paragraph is quite murky. continuous variables are routinely represented by boxy histograms. i am unclear on what you are shooting for here
- the following two paragraphs "Examine the transition..." and "This smooth curve..." are much sharper. i think two good ways to motivate the use of visual density functions are (1) smoothing the histogram (2) allowing us to show two densities on top of each other
- Continuous probability distribution box. i am nervous about "defining" a continuous probability distribution as a curve. be clear they are like discrete distributions, but with variables taking continuous valued outcomes. then, a density plot (distinct from the distribution) is an appropriate and useful visualization tool

Section 2.2.2: Probabilities from continuous distributions
----------------------------------------------------
- "The fact that... probabilities" is too big a jump. 
- "Consider again Example 2.8: how" = "Returning to Example 2.8, how"
- "The same principles of the example applies to the distribution, however," = "The concept is similar."
- " instead of adding up the area of the boxes, the area under the curve is totaled," = "instead of using the area in the shaded boxes, we use the area in the shaded region under the curve". this implies we include a second panel here. one with two boxes of the histogram shaded dark blue. the second as you currently have
- "Three people are randomly selected from US adults" = "Three US adults are randomly selected"
