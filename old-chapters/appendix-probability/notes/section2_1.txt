Chapter 2: Probability
----------------------------------------------------
- ", and one... former" = "", or reworded
- "that everyone... many" = "people are familiar with"
- "even if not by name" = "even if they don't know them by name"
- this sentence might be better phrased as "you may already be familiar with some aspects of probability..."
- "their formalization... quantitative" = "formalization of the concepts"
- "and with" = ", using"

Section 2.1: Basics of probability
----------------------------------------------------
- Example 2.1, include the possible outcomes explicitly, 1,2,3,4,5,6
- Example 2.4, include the positive calculation as well. it is 1,3,4,5,6
- Example 2.5, "Then, 1/6... die is a 1" = ""
- i really like the idea of starting off a chapter or subsection with representative questions, and giving informal answers. we should consider doing this as a regular part of all chapters or sections. a small naming change, such as "2.0: Representative problems in probability" could be useful as well

Section 2.1.1: Probability
----------------------------------------------------
- maybe we should call this section "Defining probability"
- "; not everything is predictable" = ""
- the sentence "For instance,... sampling" could be primed slightly more in the previous chapter
- "The structure... randomness" = "In probability, we try to understand random processes, and build tools to describe them."
- "The label chance... for chance: probability" = ""
- "This section focuses... probability" are we really going to talk about the rules ?
- "In probability, ... outcomes" = "Problems in probability are often framed in terms of events and outcomes"
- we then need an formal introduction of the concept "events". i was thinking about this, but one did not come immediately to mind. this makes me think we might be better off just saying probability is framed by outcomes alone
- "Probability is... outcome occurring". i am not sure how many "definitions" of probability we should have
- re: "response" font. this is an interesting question. i think using the response font for all outcomes in the entire book seems like a good idea. this is also an opportunity for us to use color
- "many many times, technically an infinite number of times" = "an infinite number of times"
- "as a percentage" = "as a percentage between 0 and 100, or a fraction where the numerator is equal to or less than the denominator"
- paragraph "In Example 2.1, what does it... " this is the core of probability. we should be very clear. how about using an algorithmic explanation of what you are communicating. a few points are slightly unclear in the current set up (eg. it is slightly unclear whether these roles are conditional)
- paragraph "Formally, this convergence". it might be helpful to use some notation and an example here, e.g. \hat{p} \approx p. this spares you from the cumbersome phrase "the observed proportion of events with a particular outcome", which becomes simply \hat{p}
- "There will be times where the" = "Occasionally the". this also avoids a double "times"
- paragraph "Probability notation will be used... ". avoid "used heavily". can events be structured in a fashion similar to what we used for variables in chapter 1. e.g. 1 / rolling a 1 / the value shown on the top of the dice after the first roll. avoid "all of this notation"
- concerning Exercise 2.1. we need to be clear about the difference between process / variable / outcome / value of variable
- paragraph "The purpose of Exercise 2.1... occur" and follow up "Whether a process". avoid these labels since they are somewhat arbitrary and nonstandard. i agree with the theme of this paragraph, but i think the buzz word here is "model". in a sense, nothing is random, we just can't measure it completely or account for every possible detail. as a result, we create a (stochastic) "model", which approximates the (un-knowable, but deterministic) truth.
- "Sometimes processes are... so it seems random" = four sentences

Section 2.1.2: Disjoint or mutually exclusive outcomes
----------------------------------------------------
- begin with the punch line first. "Outcomes are called disjoint if the occurrence of one precludes the occurrence of another. For example, the outcomes of a coin flip are disjoint; the coin lands either "heads" or "tails", but not both."
- paragraph beginning "In Example 2.2..." here again, begin with the punch line. "Calculating probabilities for disjoint outcomes can be easy. For instance, the probability of rolling a "1" or a "2", etc, is simply \begin{eqnarray} \end{eqnarray}. Notice, for disjoint events, $P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)$." as you have in the additional rule box
- addition rule box. "Addition Rule" = "Addition Rule of Disjoint Outcomes"
- "While probability rules". "while" is inappropriate start since first and second halves of sentence agree
- first two sentences can be replaced with "A collection of outcomes is called a set".
- "Then the probability... the same as" = "Then the probability of "A" is "
- "The first probability..." this comes back to having a framework, ala variables ch 1, for probability and outcomes
- "Two sets of outcomes... collections" = "We can use the idea sets to find examples of events that are not disjoint."
- "let B be" = "suppose B is"
- "For instance... $B = \{4, 6\}$." = "For instance, suppose $A = \{1, 2\}$, $B = \{4, 6\}$ and $D = \{2, 3\}$. A and B are disjoint because they don't share any outcomes". On the other hand, A and D are not disjoint as we can see in the diagram below.
- why no figure name and caption for this figure ?
- no bold on "from here onward"
- exercises 2.3 - 2.5 can appear earlier in the section
- "suppose a card is randomly select". transition needed here. e.g. "Let's consider calculations for events that are not mutually exclusive."
- "# of cards counted twice" from equation. is it better to use "number of face card diamonds" here and explain the double count in the paragraph
- "one circle captures the diamonds" = "one circle represents diamonds". same for face cards
- "probabilities are in provided in gray" = "probabilities are shown in gray"
- paragraph "Equation 2.2 can... disjoint or not." = "Adjusting our the Addition Rule for the possibility of overlapping events and double counting gives us the General Addition Rule."
- A and B are more standard than OC_1, OC_2. A_1, A_2 would also work
- Exercise 2.8 and other instances, does "that it is 5clubs" = "that it is THE 5clubs"
- Exercise 2.9. a second venn diagram question could be useful

Section 2.1.3: Probability distribution
----------------------------------------------------
- title of subsection = "Probability distributions" or "Concepts of probability distributions"
- ", so there must be an error in the table" = ""
- "sum of the weights matches up" = "sum of the weights match up"
- "instead of ingredients... outcomes" = "instead of amounts of each ingredient there are probabilities for each outcome"
- i quite like the recipe example
- box "Probability Distribution" = "Rules for probability distributions"
- "the importance in plotting data to provide quick insight" = "the importance of plotting data to provide quick summaries"
- invert sentence "Another example of a probability distribution..."

Section 2.1.4: Complement of an event
----------------------------------------------------
- "There were in fact... getting a 2". use the problem as the thought, and reference the example as the afterthought
- "The first was... 1" = "As we saw in Example 2.4, we could take the probabilities of all events minus the probability of just a 2:". avoid two colons in one sentence
- "compute the outcomes" = "compute the probability of all the outcomes that are "not 2"". you are computing "probabilities", not "outcomes"
- "In either case, ... forethought" = "In simple examples, computing either with be feasible in a few simple steps. However, using the complement when possible will save a lot of time as problems grow in complexity. We'll see an example of this in Section ZZQ."
- the notation $OC^C$ raises the point about using $A$ and $A^c$ again. i am also realizing, these students may have recently finished geometry, where $AB$ is the line segment from A to B
- "then $D^C... outcomes" = "then its complement $D^C = {1, 4, 5, 6}$ is the set of all other outcomes"
- "Since an outcome... must be 1" = "Notice the total probability of an outcome and its complement is 1, since the two events completely cover the outcome space". (include venn diagram to illustrate)
- "Additionally, ... use formula" = "We can express this mathematically as $P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$ where $A$ and $A^c$ by the addition rule of disjoint events. The definition of the complements is often presented after subtracting $P(A^c)$ from both sides as we see below"
- Complement box. "When computing $P(OC)$... very useful"= "". included previously as suggestion in edits
- it seems we will want to introduce $S$ earlier

Section 2.1.5: Independence
----------------------------------------------------
- "On the other hand..." begin with the punch line. "On the other hand, heights of family members are associated, not independent. If you are very tall, it is likely at least one of your parents is very tall."
- "example of considering two independent" = "example of two independent"
- "two independent events..." we need to discuss the use of "events", "outcomes", "S" and "processes"
- "Both Example 5 and this example..." no italics here
- Product Rule box. "Product Rule" = "Product Rule for Independent Events"
- "probability that they all" = "probability they all"
- "the Product Rule can be applied to variables in addition to events". i don't understand what you are saying here
- footnote after "is about $50\%$... "women actually varies" = "women varies". avoid double usage of "actual"
