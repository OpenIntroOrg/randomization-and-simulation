The following two sections are ready for comments

2.5.3 - Linear combinations of random variables
- - - - -
- "So far.. into pieces." = "So far, we have thought of each variable as being a complete story, in and of itself. Sometimes it is more appropriate to use a combination of variables."
- "on day 1" = "on Monday"
- "on day 2" = "on Tuesday"
- "that represents" = "to represent"
- "ultimate source" = "each source"
- "model it" = "model them"
- "The expectation.. individual times." = "We will see that the expectation of a sum of variables is always the sum of the expectation for each each variable."
- "In total, how.. spend?" = "In total, what is her expected financial state when she is done with the auction?"
- "on combinations" = "concerning combinations"
- "it is only guaranteed" = "it is guaranteed"
- "are some numbers." = "are some constant numbers."
- "net gain/loss" = "net gain or loss"
- "of combinations" = "of (non-linear) combinations"
- Linear combinations box: do you want to include the formula as well "E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y)". this might clarify what happens to the constants
- "gain/loss" = "gain or loss"
- is example 2.89 clear that we are ignoring compounding ?


2.5.4 - Variability in linear combinations of random variables
- - - - -
- "a combination" = "a linear combination"
- "the outcome" = "with that combination of variables"
- "The net" = "The expected net"
- great work on the stock example
- "during months from" = "during the 36 months from"
- "This equality assumes" = "It is important to note this equality assumes"
- "independent" = "{\bf independent}"
- "squaring the coefficients" = "squaring the constants"
- throughout John's commuting example, would you like to add the wrinkle.. "Wednesday is trash day (or something), and his commute is twice as long"
