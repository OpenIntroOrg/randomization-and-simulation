2.1
good

2.2
(a) & (b) solutions: Also provide a simplified fraction (9/19).

2.3
(a) solution: "get 50\% heads and 50\% tails" = "get something very close to 50\% heads"
(b) solution: Add comma after "than 40\%"
(b) & (c) solutions: "would be closer" = "would often be closer"
(b) & (c) solution: "expected value" = "expected value than if we used a sample size of 10"
(d) solution: Comma after "expected proportion"

2.4
solution: Replace asterisks by \times [If can quickly run through the document via Find to replace asterisks that are used for multiplication with \times, that would be excellent, but this is overall a lower priority than other edits. I won't note this update elsewhere since using Find seems more efficient.]
solution: "probability, ... threes." = "probability."

2.5
(c) solution: "= 1 - 0.001" = "\approx 1 - 0.001"

2.6
(b) solution: Consider reordering the probabilities to be "P(1,4) + P(2,3)  + P(3,2) + P(4,1)"

2.7
"Democrat Independent" = "Democrat, or Independent" (comma + "or")
I wonder if it would be useful to prompt the students to draw a Venn diagram for independent and swing voters (part f) as part (b). I think it is easier to construct a Venn diagram than answer the questions outright. If the Venn diagram comes earlier, consider dropping part (c) since if it is so similar to (b).
(a) solution: "that" = "who"
(b) solution: Consider using plain language to reason to the solution, e.g. "Each Independent voter is either a swing voter or not. Since 35\% of voters are Independents and 11\% are swing voters, the other 24\% must not be swing voters."
(c) solution: Similar change to (b) solution.
(d) solution: Possibly reference the rule they are using, e.g. add the following to the beginning: "Use the General Addition Rule."
(e) "not swing" = "nor swing"
(f) "these probabilities" = "the variables and their associated probabilities"
(f) solution: Fancy!

2.8
"giving" = "to give"
Same general comment as for 2.7 about moving Venn diagram to earlier and possibly dropping part (c).
(b) "but only speak" = "and speak only"
(b) & (c) solutions: same recommendation as 2.7(b) solution.
(c) "but speak" = "and speak"
(f) "these probabilities" = "the variables and their associated probabilities"
(f) solution: Three of the numbers in the Venn diagram are off by a decimal. Either proportions or percentages seem like they would be fine (but if percentages, consider stating so explicitly in the solution to (f)).

2.9
"they cannot be both" = "events cannot be both disjoint and independent"
(b) "a friend you study with from your class" = "your class study partner"
(b) solution: "a friend you study with from your class gets" = "your class study partner get" (if not changing overall wording, drop "s" on "gets")
(b) solution: "together ... other" = "together, your study habits would be related, which suggests your course performances are also related"
(c) I think there should be a comma after "time"
(c) solution: To provide a little more intuition, add the following at the end: "This question is more generally about independent events. If two things are unrelated, then one occurring does not preclude the other from occurring"

2.10
(b) "all" = "all of the"
(a) & (b) solutions: Add commas between each Wrong/Right item.

2.11
(d) solution: "Independence, which may not be a reasonable assumption since" = "The independence assumption may not be reasonable since"

2.12
"that roughly" = "that each year roughly"
"more days" = "more days due to sickness" (I think this addition is correct, at least based on the questions)
(a) "due to sickness" = "due to sickness this year"
(f) solution: "siblings and" = "siblings, and"

2.13
"Indicate what, if anything, is wrong ... Statistics." = "Each part below is a proposed grade distribution for a class. Identify each as a valid or invalid probability distribution, and explain your reasoning."
Each solution below is a proposed full revision. The proposed wording above is intended to help facilitate quick, pointed solutions.
(a) solution: Invalid. The sum of the probabilities is greater than 1 ($0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.2$).
(b) solution: Valid. The probabilities are all between 0 and 1, and they sum to 1. In this class, everyone gets C's (!).
(c) solution: Invalid. The sum of the probabilities is less than 1 ($0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0 + 0 = 0.9$).
(d) solution: Invalid. There is a negative probability listed (-0.1 for F).
(e) solution: Valid. The probabilities are all between 0 and 1, and they sum to 1. In this distribution, 80\% of students get C's or higher.
(f) solution: Invalid. There is a negative probability listed (-0.1 for B).

2.14
"of designed" = "designed"
"The following table ... health coverage." = "The following table summarizes two variables for the respondents: weight status via body mass index (BMI) and health coverage, which describes whether each respondent had health insurance."
(a) & (b) "one an" = "one"
(a) & (b) "s/he" = "the respondent" OR "he" (for consistency with other questions)
(b) "and" = "or"
(b) solution: "121,713" = "157,026"
(b) solution: "0.3528" = "0.4352"

As I'm sure you noted already, Continuous Distribution was moved to 2.5.

2.15
The goal of this question seems to be: Ensure students can translate histogram data into percentages/fractions. I'll be operating on this premise for comments/edits.
I'm proposing that parts (d)-(f) be cut, along with the gender histograms (bring these plots up later, if they are referred to in later exercises). The six parts are repetitive, and the gender breakdown isn't adding any value. (SBS box plots would be more useful if part of the goal is to show weights differ by gender.) For these reasons, parts (a)-(c) seem adequate in getting students to think about areas/fractions.
"Below is a histogram ... gender." = "The histogram shown represents the weights (in kg) of 47 female and 97 male cats." [Note: I may end up adjusting the histogram position for this question.]
Each part below is a proposed full revision. I did not edit (d)-(f) or their solutions.
(a) What fraction of these cats weigh less than 2.5 kg?
(b) What fraction of these cats weigh between 2.5 and 2.75 kg?
(c) What fraction of these cats weigh between 2.75 and 3.5 kg?

2.16
(a) solution: "about \$27,500" = "very roughly about \$30,000" (being too precise may make students think they are missing something about how this calculation is done)
(a) solution: "There are" = "The distribution is skewed to the high end, and there are"
(d) solution: "$P($less than ... category." = "If these variables were independent, then the percentage of females who earn less than \$50,000 (71.8\%) would equal the percentage of all people who make less than \$50,000 (62.2\%). Since this is not the case, gender and income are dependent."

2.17
(b-i) & (b-iii) solutions: Remove "If we know ... independent," (or also add it for part (b), which also requires the assumption)
(c) solution: "No because" = "No, because"

2.18
"Given that a randomly sampled person likes peanut butter, what's" = "A randomly sampled person likes peanut butter. What's"
solution: "0.624" = "0.975"

Both 2.19 and 2.20 should be additional parts of EOCE 2.7 and 2.8; conditional probabilities are not needed to check independence, and these questions are natural extensions of the previous questions, so putting the independence questions on their own looks forced. (I'm proposing this update with the understanding that this would reduce the EOCE count by 2.)
- - -

2.19
"2.7" should be made into a simple reference; right now it seems to be written as 2.\ref{someLabel}. It should just be \ref{someLabel}, otherwise when included with the full text this reference will be 2.2.7.
"suggests that" = "indicates that about" ("suggests" makes it sound like the poll was haphazardly completed and so we shouldn't think of it as reliable)
"are the being" = "are being"
Note that the solution does not check independence of the variables, only independence of the events (current solution wording indicates it checks variable independence).
Alternative question if as part of 2.7: "Is the event that someone is a swing voter independent of the event that someone is a political Independent?"
Proposed alternative solution that checks independence directly: "$P($Indep.$)\times P($swing$) = 0.35\times0.23 = 0.08$, which does not equal $P($Indep. and swing$) = 0.11$, so the events are dependent."

2.20
"As described in Exercise 2.\ref{someLabel}, the" = "The"
"both categories" = "both categories (see Exercise~\ref{someLabel})"
Alternative question if as part of 2.8: "Is the event that someone lives below the poverty line independent of the event that speaks English at home?"
Proposed alternative solution that checks independence directly: "$P(PL)\times P(LOE) = 0.146\times 0.207 = 0.030$, which does not equal $P(PL$ and $LOE) = 0.042$, so the events are dependent."

2.21
(d) "best, or" = "best or" (the comma adds a slight wrinkle suggesting that the question make be asking either/or)

2.22
Adjust 2.14 reference
It seems beneficial to convert the table to a relative frequency table. This would put things more in the context of conditional probability and also allow some easier language in the individual parts.
"Answer the following ... table." = "In the table below, the counts have been replaced with a relative frequency table. The table values are based on a very large sample and are representative of the US population, so you may treat these as very precise probabilities. For each part" OR if not going with the table change, ""
(a) - (c) solutions: update counts to be probabilities if implementing change above.
(d) solution: "No ... obese." = "No, because the probability that a person is obese varies between the two health coverage categories. That is, knowing something about someone's health coverage provides useful information in predicting whether the person is obese, which means the variables cannot be independent."

2.23
I think it would be helpful to implement similar changes to those in 2.22 (i.e. use a relative frequency table, then update solutions accordingly).
(e) - (h) "s/he" = "he"
Cut out (a) - (c). They are too easy (also made (d) too easy) and made the data feel dull by the time I reached the more interesting questions (e) - (h).

2.24
Examine last comment before implementing edits
(a) & (b) "man" = "respondent" (small sample, less reliable point estimates)
(c) & (d) "chosen" = "chosen respondent"
(e) & (f) "man" = "respondent" (same reasoning as (a) and (b))
(c) "has" = "have"
(g) "another eye color" = "another eye color to have a partner with blue eyes"
Cut out (a) - (c) for same reasons as in 2.23.

2.25
With such small sample sizes, this question could be a bit misleading. (There is no statistical difference in the conditional probabilities.) Option 1 leaves the question very much intact. Option 2 keeps the same general question but modifies it to hide the small sample issues (and eliminate the plots, by requirement if the small sample issues are to be hidden). Option 3 is an entirely new question that could replace this cats question altogether.
If keep a reference back to the previous exericse, adjust \ref.
Option 1
Put the histograms for each gender by this question.
"Exercise ... female?" = "Two histograms are shown below representing the weights (in kg) of a random sample of 144 cats, where one plot is shown for female cats (47 cats) and another for male cats (97 cats). Use these plots to answer the following question: if we chose one of these 144 cats at random and found that it weighted under 2.5 kg, is it more likely to be a male or female cat?"
solution: "In order ... female." = "There are about 60 cats with weights below 2.5 kg. Most of these cats are female, so it is more likely that the cat is female."
Option 2
No plots needed.
"Exercise ... female?" = "Approximately 35\% of grown house cats are female and 65\% are male. Of female cats, about 75\% weigh less than 2.5 kg. Of male cats, about 25\% weigh less than 2.5 kg. Suppose we were able to randomly select a house cat and that cat weighed less than 2.5 kg. Is it more likely that the cat is male or female?"
solution: Use a tree diagram for the solution, which also sets the question up as a reasonable counterpart to 2.26.
Option 3
Data: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/05/us/politics/wisconsin-recall-exit-polls.html?hp
Question "Edison Research compiled and pooled exit poll results from several sources for the Wisconsin recall election of Scott Walker representing a total sample of 2,457 voters. They found that 53\% of the respondents voted in favor of Scott Walker. Additionally, they estimated that of those who did vote in favor for Scott Walker, 37\% had a college degree while 44\% of those who voted against Scott Walker had a college degree. Suppose we randomly sampled a person who participated in the exit poll and found that he had a college degree; what is the probability that he voted for Scott Walker?
Solution: "$P($Walker support $|$ has college degree $) = \frac{0.1961}{0.1961 + 0.2068} = 0.49$." Corresponding tree diagram: myPDF("ScottWalkerRecallTreeDiagram.pdf", 4.5, 2.4); treeDiag(c("Support Walker", "College degree"), c(0.53, 0.47), p2=list(c(0.37, 0.63), c(0.44, 0.56)), cex.main=1.1); dev.off()

2.26
"This genetic test" ?= "The genetic test"

2.27
If going with option 2 or 3 for 2.25, consider swapping the places of 2.25 and this question since this one guides the setup of the tree diagram.
(a) solution: Compress the plot down in size (e.g. see 2.25 Option 3 code's myPDF plotting dimensions and also the treeDiag optional argument(s)). Also try: "Can construct?" = "\nCan construct\nbox plots?"
(b) "she" = "he" (for consistency in EOCEs)

2.28
"is an HIV carrier" = "is infected with HIV"
Solution: If this will get distributed, adjust the plotting dimensions so that the PDF is a bit smaller (to enlarge the text in the LaTeX output).

2.29
Solution: Adjust PDF plotting dimensions to be smaller and possibly also the treeDiag arguments (see Option 3 for 2.25).
Solution: "he/she" = "he"

2.30
Solution: If this will get distributed, adjust width of plotting dimensions so that the branch descriptions don't run into branches.

2.31
"blue and" = "blue, and" (for consistency with main text... either way is correct, but generally just stick with one for a particular work)
"urn with" = "urn containing" and then "in it" = ""

2.32
looks good

2.33
"Suppose the same urn ... from the urn." = "Imagine you have an urn with 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 orange marbles in it." (The second sentence only applies to first two parts, and the exercise title indicates that it is a follow-up to an earlier exercise, so no need to reference the specific exercise.)
(a) "Suppose the marble is blue." = "Suppose you draw a marble and it is blue."
(b) "Suppose the marble is orange and" = "Suppose you draw a marble and it is orange, and then"
(d) solution: "When ... are dependent." = "They are dependent. Notice that the probability of a blue marble on the second draw depended on the marble color in the first draw in parts (a) and (b)." (Make other adjustments if not using this solution. The current solution has a run-on first sentence, the last part of the first sentence is incorrect, and there should be a comma after "example".)

2.34
Proposed edits below are to make this into a harder question that focuses on why observations in small samples can be treated as independent; this second topic doesn't seem to be found in any other questions. If you don't want to consider modifications, all current parts look okay and correct.
"Suppose ... follows." = "" (only if going with new parts below)
(a) Drop this part.
(b) "Find the probability of drawing a hardcover, then a paperback fiction when drawing without replacement."
(b) solution: Update "13" = "28" and "0.0859" = "0.1850"
(c) - (e) Drop these.
(c, new) "The first book is a fiction book, and the second is a hardcover book."
(c, new) solution: "Break into two disjoint statements (let F=fiction, N=nonfiction, H=hardcover, P=paperback):
\begin{align*}
P(\text{1st F, 2nd H}) &= P(\text{(1st FH and 2nd H) OR (1st FP and 2nd H)}) \\
&= P(\text{1st FH and 2nd H}) + P(\text{1st FP and 2nd H}) \\
&= \frac{13}{95}\frac{27}{94} + \frac{59}{95}\frac{28}{94} = 0.2243
\end{align*}"
(d, new) "Calculate the probability of the scenario in part (c), except this time complete the calculations under the scenario that the first book is placed back on the bookcase before randomly drawing the second book."
(d, new) solution: "Same as part (c), except now each denominator has $95^2$ instead of $95\times94$: 0.2219."
(e, new) "The answers to parts (c) and (d) are very similar. Explain why this would be."
(e, new) solution: "Because there are so many books on the bookcase and we are only drawing two books, the probability associated with the second book will be almost entirely unaffected by whatever book is drawn first. This makes the second draw under the ``without replacement'' setting almost independent, meaning it is about equivalent to drawing with replacement."

2.35
Solution: "are wearing jeans we simply add" = "are wearing jeans, we add"

2.36
"29th" = "29th, and assume that births are evenly distributed throughout the year"

2.37
(b) solution: "Chances are ... much lower" = "For example, it might be argued that the proportion of smokers among students who go to the gym at 9am on a Saturday morning would be lower" (avoiding a strong conjecture)

There are three gambling card games over Exercises 2.38 - 2.43. Since none of these are real gambling games and all about the same level of difficulty (though the last is the easiest) but do not touch on new ideas, I think two should be cut. Exercises 2.38 and 2.39 seem like the most natural ones to go. Under this scenario, move 2.43 and 2.44 to be 2.38 and 2.39 since both of these exercises are easier than the current 2.40, 2.41, and 2.42. Then 2.45 to 2.48 can become 2.43 to 2.46. The numbering below pertains to the original numbering.
- - -

2.38
(b) solution: "You should not ... \$4.14." = "If you are playing with the goal of making money, you should not play unless the cost of the game is less than \$4.14."

2.39
Looks good

2.40
Fix \ref
Merge first two paragraphs.
Seems reasonable to put (a) and (b) into the question since this is just one part in previous exercises, i.e. merge (a) and (b) into the paragraph, or make them into their own paragraph.
Looks like everything in the solution can get dropped except the table in part (b).

2.41
Fix \ref
(a) After "$Y = 3X$.", add "From Exercise~\ref{previousExercise}: $E(X)=-0.0526$ and $V(X) = 0.9972$."
(b) solution: "games. Then $W = X+X+X$." = "games, and let $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$ represent the winning from the three individual games. Then $W = X_1+X_2+X_3$."
(b) solution: Add subscripts to $X$'s, drop "3E(X) =", and drop "\sqrt{3V(X)} =".
(c) solution: "Expected" = "The expected"
(c) solution: "making this game riskier." = "making this game more volatile. In each case we can expect to lose money, but notice that in the ``low risk'' small-stakes game we are likely to just lose a more stable amount."

2.42
Sounds good on dropping American Airlines reference.
(b) solution: Add at beginning: "We assume independence between individual fliers. This probably is not exactly correct, but it would provide a helpful first approximation."
(b) solution: Consider numbering the $X$'s.

"ounces) and" = "ounces), and"
(c) "Based on this example, ... variances?" = "Using the context of this exercise, explain why we add variances when we subtract one random variable from another."



2.23 (a) - (h) If implementing the change to the relative frequency table, then "respondent" = "person" seems reasonable. If I had prior objections to generalizing like this, I think the objections were about students taking frequency tables that may not necessarily be representative or have a big sample size, and calculating probabilities for general populations (where the probabilities may actually be very off due to sample size/methodology). Since we can choose which tables to allow generalization in this way (i.e. just big representative samples), I'm okay with it when it is appropriate (representative sample with n > 1000).
