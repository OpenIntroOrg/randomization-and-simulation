-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Good!


2.2.4 General multiplication rule
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- "for another variable process" = "for another variable or process"

-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Good.


2.2.6 Tree diagrams
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- In Example 2.53 "got" = "received"
- "will correspond to the secondary branches" = "will be shown on the secondary branches"
- "also got an A on" = "also received an A on"


2.2.7 Bayes' Theorem
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- "is not always possible" = "is not possible"
- "of a conditional and marginal probabilities using" = "of a conditional probability and a marginal probability using"
- "Plugging in .. Bayes' Theorem." = "We can see an application of Bayes' Theorem by substituting the resulting probability expressions into the numerator and denominator of the original conditional probability."
- "except that this time" = "except this time"
- "update how much .. sporting event" = "update our belief about whether there is a sporting event"
