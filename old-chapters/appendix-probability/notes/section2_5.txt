Section 2.5.2: Expectation
----------------------------------------------------
- interesting approach in figure 2.17. i am not sure if it works or not. it seems the idea should be clear without going for an inverted presentation as well as a standard balancing-on-a-pyramid presentation
- for example "The idea of a... mean of 5" seems adequate
- figure 2.18. consider unboxing, making the triangle smaller and darker than the distributions and skipping the x axis. maybe just use the xaxis label "\bar{x}"

Section 2.5.3: Variability in random variables
----------------------------------------------------
- "money you expect to take in" = "revenue you expect to generate"
- "should" = "might" or "would". "should" has an unpleasant tone
- "The way to find... take the average," = "Section zzq introduced a method for finding the variance and standard deviation of a sample when [some simple situation is encountered]. We consider a more general case here."
- "The standard... the variance" = "We calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance, just as before."
- variance box. call this box "General variance formula"
- variance box. move "If X... P(X = x_k)" to the random variable box
- variance box. "then the variance of X, \sigma^2 is" = "Then the variance of X, denoted by Var(x) or the symbol $\sigma^2$ is"
- "The standard deviation ... \sqrt{sigma^2})" = ""
- "To compute these quantities" = ""
- give the total instead of "ML". 
- "In this table... meaningless" = ""
- move the footnote "technically, the units... of little use" to the body of the text
