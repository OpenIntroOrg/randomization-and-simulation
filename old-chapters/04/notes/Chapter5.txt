5.6.5: Assessing the geometric distribution for stock data
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- this section relies somewhat heavily on the geometric distribution. perhaps we could start with an example of testing whether day are normal ?  this would give students the chance to try doing a goodness of fit analysis, using a familiar model, and while reviewing their normal probability tables. i'm not sure if what i'm proposing is best as an additional section before 5.6.5 (making 5.6.5 a "Special topic" section), or if it could be written at the beginning of a 5.6.5 with a more general title. i know time is running short, and i take no offense if this idea doesn't make it to the top of your radar
