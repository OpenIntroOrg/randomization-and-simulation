8.2 - Model selection
--------------------------------------------------------
- i am unclear whether the remark "why spend money.. unimportant variables" is meant to be rhetorical
- "Next section we.. model are satisfied." = ""
- then, the sentence "In this section we.. from the model." becomes part of the preceding paragraph
- additional text "In this section, and in practice, the model that includes all available explanatory variables is often referred to as the "full" model. Our goal is assess whether the full model is the best model."


8.2.1 - Using regression output to evaluate variable inclusion
--------------------------------------------------------
- "Table 8.4 shows.. variables." = "Table 8.4 provides a summary of the regression output for the full model of Ebay auctions presented in the previous section."
- "The p-values provided.. in the model." = ""
- having not read 8.2.2 yet, this sections seems a bit abrupt. i wonder if titling it "Identifying variables that are candidates for exclusion" would help
- it might also be helpful to draw the connection between the fact that [failing to reject the null] implies [the coefficient could be zero] implies [the variable may not be a useful predictor of the response]. we might even include an equation that reads $\hat{y} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + 0 x_3 + \beta_4 x_4$, so they can see the variable falling out of the model
- perhaps this section could prime 8.2.2 by highlighting that removing one variable may change the p-values on another


8.2.2 - Two model selection strategies
--------------------------------------------------------
- "There are two.. {\em forward-selection}." = "Two common strategies for adding or removing variables in a multiple regression model are called {\em backward-selection} and {\em forward-selection}. These techniques are often referred to as {\bf stepwise}, because they add or delete one variable at a time as they "step" through the candidate predictors."
- "Then, one-by-one," = "One-by-one"
- "until all variables.. significant." = "until only variables with statistically significant p-values remain."
- "In each elimination step, we" = "The strategy within each elimination step is to"
- Model selection strategies box: "then it adds what in" = "then it adds in"
- regarding your question ("I'm not certain.."). i thought about this for a few minutes, but i am unable to reject of accept your claim. let me know if you'd like me to think about it more or discuss it together
- perhaps we could talk about this section a bit if you are interested
