8.4 - Regression with categorical variables
--------------------------------------------------------
- "Regression with categorical variables" = "ANOVA and regression with categorical variables"
- it might be useful to draw a closer connection to section 8.1.1
- "multiple corresponding parameter estimates," = "multiple corresponding parameter estimates\footnote{To be precise, if the variable has $C$ categories, then there will be $C-1$ parameter estimates},"
- "We learn" = "In this section, we'll learn"
- "that uses" = "and"
- "mean outcome" = "mean of the outcome variable"
- "represents the mean for category $j$." = "represents the mean of the outcome variable with respect to category $j$."
- in equation 8.18, do we want to use "$x_{i,j}$" = "$y_{i,j}$"
- "College department" = "College departments"
- "If we want to label students, we would label" = "We could label"
- "We could estimate" = "Then we could estimate"
- "Can you determine if" = "Can you visually determine if"
- "discern. The data" = "discern, because the data"
- "lower mean/center" = "lower mean"
- "In the groups IV" = "Investigating groups IV"
- ", the differences" = ", we see the differences"
- "centers is noticeable" = "centers are noticeable"
- why are we including table 8.12 ?


8.4.1 - Is batting performance related to player position in MLB?
--------------------------------------------------------
- "for each variable are in" = "for each variable are provided in"
- it seems we are going to focus exclusively on OF, IF, C, DH. if so, we might want to change "position (i.e. outfielder, infielder, catcher, and designated hitter)" = "position: outfielder (OF), infielder (IF), catcher (C), and designated hitter (DH)."
- in Exercise 8.21 you switched the order on DH and C. of course, this is permissible, but it is worth noting
- if using the suggestion above about, e.g., outfield (OF), then the entry for position in Table 8.13 can be shortened
- "Number of at bats" = "Number of opportunities at bat"
- "Hits" = "Number of hits" and similarly for HR and RBI
- "average, which.. gets a hit." = "average, which is (HR + H)/AB."
- in Example 8.22, would you like to add a footnote discussing an average weighted by the number of hits ?
- "we will learn.. ANOVA framework." = "we will learn how to use the $F$ statistic and ANOVA to test whether changes in means across different groups could have happened just by chance if the null was actually true."


8.4.2 - Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the $F$ test
--------------------------------------------------------
- "many groups and whether" = "many groups, and evaluate whether"
- i was previously unfamiliar with the term "mean square for the groups (MSG)"
- "means, and details" = "means. Details"
- i wonder if it would be possible to avoid references to three different names for the same thing, e.g. $df_{top}$, $df_{1}$, $df_{G}$
- additionally, in "variability in the sample means relative to the residuals" we are introducing yet additional terminology
- in the previous comment and box "The $F$ statistic and the $F$ test", "variability of residuals" is a bit new
- it might be helpful to emphasize the following framework in this section (1) we are testing whether the means are equal, (2) we assume the variances are the same across groups, (3) we then compare the between variance to the within variance. perhaps we could discuss this if you'd like. i also left a quick figure in your mailbox


8.4.3 - Reading regression and ANOVA output from software
--------------------------------------------------------
- "a computer compute the" = "a computer calculate the"
- it might be helpful to connect the F statistic here with the ratio of the two values of Mean Sq, and then with the formula provided in Section 8.4.2


8.4.4 - Graphical diagnostics for an ANOVA analysis
--------------------------------------------------------
- david, i wonder if it might be useful to move this section to an early position in 8.4. for example, discussing the constant variance assumption with this level of detail earlier might be nice
- "Nearly normal" =? "Approximate normality"
- perhaps maintain the ordering of assumptions (Independence, Nearly normal, Constant variance) in the text, and in the box (Nearly normal, Constant variance, Independence)


8.4.5 - Multiple comparisons and controlling the Type 1 Error rate
--------------------------------------------------------
- "Multiple comparisons and controlling the Type 1 Error rate" = "Multiple comparisons and controlling Type 1 Error rate"
- "there are three" = "we have three"
- "ANOVA to this data" = "ANOVA to these data"
- "There data in" = "The data in"
- "appears appears" = "appear"
- "group with no" = "group, and show no"
- here with "Independence cannot be check, so we will assume independence for the observations in each group" and in the treatment of Independence in Section 8.4.4, it might be helpful to say a little more about what we do with assumptions that can't be checked. sometimes, we feel compelled to make assumptions (and occasionally they can't be checked). in such circumstances, we may move forward with the analysis, but we bear a heightened responsibility to be especially clear about these limitations in reporting our results. i'm afraid students might mistake the tone of the current text for being a bit capricious, when, in fact, we are extra careful in circumstances that involve unverifiable assumptions
- "grades in the three" = "grades between the three"
- have we said much about $s_{pooled}$ before Example 8.31 ?
- "some difference must exist" = "some differences might exist"
- "place within the firm" = "place at the firm"


8.4.6 - Using ANOVA for multiple regression
--------------------------------------------------------
- "from R statistical software" = "(implemented with R statistical software)"
