8: Multiple regression and ANOVA
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "Then we consider" = "We will also consider"


8.1: Introduction to multiple regression
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "of denoted" = "denoted"
- "Naturally.. total auction price." = ""
- "related to other" = "related to"
- "higher or lower price" = "higher or lower prices"


8.1.1: Using categorical variables with two levels as predictors
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "using linear regression" = "using simple linear regression"
- the price is increased if a stock photo is used ?  i would not have guessed. interesting about the Wii wheels


8.1.2: Including and assessing many variables in a model
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "stock photo as utilized" = "stock photo was used"
- "indicates the duration" = "is the duration"
- "are {\bf collinear}" = "are rather {\bf collinear}"


8.1.3: Adjusted $R^2$ as a better estimate of explained variance
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- excellent work


8.2: Model selection
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "always the largest" = "always the most complicated"
- good


8.2.1: Identifying variables that may not be helpful in the model
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "and the other parameters" = "when the other explanatory variables"
- "and the other parameters" = "when the other explanatory variables"
- "Identify the p-value for both" = "Identify the p-values for both"


8.2.2: Two model selection strategies
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "The {\em full model}.. Table 8.4." = "Results corresponding to the {\em full model} for the {\tt marioKart} data are shown in Table 8.4."
- "change after eliminating" = "change, due to collinearity, after eliminating"
- "variable due to collinearity" = "variable"
- "we stop adding variables." = "neither variable is added, and we are finished."
- good job


8.3: Checking model assumptions using graphs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "verifying the variability" = "verifying that the variability"
- "However, when" = "In this example, when"
- "we are upfront and" = "we are clear and"
- "grossly violated" = "heavily violated"
- "go overboard" = "go too far"


8.4: ANOVA and regression with categorical variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "The errors have nearly" = "the errors have nearly"


8.4.1: Is batting performance related to player position in MLB?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "Major League Baseball players" = "Major League Baseball (MLB) players"


8.4.2: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the $F$ test
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "is called an {\bf F test}" = "is called an {\bf {\em F} test}"


8.4.3: Reading regression and ANOVA output from software
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- good


8.4.4: Graphical diagnostics for an ANOVA analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "There not obvious reasons" = "There are no obvious reasons"


8.4.5: Multiple comparisons and controlling Type 1 Error rate
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "but we with a" = "but we must use a"
- "would break a class up into" = "would divide a class up into"
- "is the rule that a" = "suggests that a"
- "level is applied to these" = "level is more appropriate for these"
- "describe these three relationships considered in Example 8.33" = "summarize the findings of this analysis from Example 8.33"


8.4.6: Using ANOVA for multiple regression
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- "textbook, and this" = "textbook. This"
