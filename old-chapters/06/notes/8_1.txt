8 - Next steps in regression
--------------------------------------------------------
- "Next steps in regression" = "Multiple regression and ANOVA"
- "The field of regression.. outcome variable." = "The principles of simple linear regression with one numerical predictor and one numerical response lay the foundation for more sophisticated regression methods used in a wide range of challenging settings. In Chapter 8, we explore multiple regression, which introduces the possibility of more than one predictor. Then we consider methods for analysis of variance (ANOVA), a tool useful both in practice and when learning about the mechanics of regression."


8.1 - Introduction to multiple regression
--------------------------------------------------------
- "Multiple regression.. are used." = "Multiple regression extends the simple bi-variate regression (two variables $x$, and $y$) to the case that still has one response, but may have many predictors (of denoted $x_1, x_2, x_3..$)."
- "auctions for a game" = "auctions of a video game"
- "does having.. higher" = "are longer auctions associated with higher"
- "Or how much" = "And, on average, how much"
- "Wii wheels" = "Wii circular controllers"
- "We will.. on Ebay." = "The data set {\tt marioKart} includes results from 143 auctions."


8.1.1 - Using categorical variables with two levels as predictors
--------------------------------------------------------
- "the condition variable and" = "a variable describing the condition of the game ("new" or "used"), and "
- "coded into 0" = "coded using 0"
- "used in a" = "incorporated into a"
- what is the purpose of the equation just above equation 8.1 ?  also, why doesn't it include "stockPhoto". i wonder if section 8.1.1 should be moved to chapter 7
- "allows us to interpret the coefficient" = "allows for a simple interpretation of the coefficient"
- "game is used" = "game is in "used" condition"
- "so the.. 42.87." = "and the auction price predicted from the model would be $42.87 + $10.90*(0) = $42.87."
- "game is new" = "game is in new condition"
- "$10.90" = "$10.90*(1)"
- "The coefficient of" = "We now see clearly that the coefficient of {\tt condNew} estimates the difference ($10.90) in the total auction price when the game is new ($53.77) versus used ($42.87)"
- "the stock photo variable" = "the variable {\tt stockPhoto}"
- "found that auctions whose" = "found that auctioned items whose"
- "photo tend to" = "photo tended to"
- the question "Does this mean.. unique photo?" is a little unclear to me. is this a question about causation, or expected change, or something else ?
- i'm now reading your suggested solution. perhaps we could expand the question a little by using "for about $4.17" = "for exactly $4.17", and then asking students to comment on both "causation and randomness"
- after reading the entire section, i still wonder if it might be better placed in chapter 7


8.1.2 - Including and assessing many variables in a model
--------------------------------------------------------
- "Sometimes.. underlying structure." = "Sometimes there is underlying structure or relationships between the predictor variables."
- "more more" = "more"
- "$x_1$ the game" = "$x_1$ is the game"
- "$x_2$ whether" = "$x_2$ is whether"
- "$x_4" the number" = "$x_4 is the number"
- "price and the variables" = "price and the available explanatory variables"
- "even while this linear model isn't perfect, we might find that it fits the data reasonably well." = "while no model is perfect, we wish to explore the possibility that this one may fit the data reasonably well."
- "by minimizing" = "by selecting $\hat{\beta_0}, \hat{\beta_1}, .. , \hat{\beta_4}$ that minimize"
- "The output for" = "Output for"
- "of the $x_4$ variable" = "of variable $x_4$"
- "this underlying" = "this particular underlying"
- "eliminated, thought.. account." = "eliminated (though bias from other lurking variables may still remain)."


8.1.3 - Adjusted $R^2$ as a better estimate of explained variance
--------------------------------------------------------
- "by the model:" = "by the model, so that"
- "multiple regression framework." = "multiple regression framework, but a small enhancement can often be even more informative."
- Adjusted $R^2$ box: you might consider "\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}" = "\times \frac{n-1}{n-p-1}"
- we might do a little more on the intuition here. perhaps a question like "Suppose you added another predictor to the model, but the variance of the errors $Var(\hat{\epsilon}_i)$ didn't go down. What would happen to the $R^2$? What would happen to the adjusted $R^2$?". Then, we could include additional text along the lines of "The idea that a predictor that doesn't explain any extra variance would actually "hurt" the adjusted $R^2$ highlights a common sentiment in statistics: avoid making a model more complicated than it needs to be."
