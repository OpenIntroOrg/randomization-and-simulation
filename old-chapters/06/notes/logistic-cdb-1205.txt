8.4 Logistic regression
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- "In this section ... different from the normal distribution." = "Previous sections (see 7.2.2 in particular) introduced linear models in the framework of normally distributed residuals. However, the linear models we saw before won't also be appropriate. For example, if the response variable is binary, then the residuals can't possibly be normally distributed! In this section we will introduce logistic regression for binary response variables. Logistic regression is a type of generalized linear model for settings where residuals look completely different from the normal distribution."
- "binomial or Poisson distribution." = "binomial (for binary data) or Poisson (for count data) distribution."
- "We first model outcomes according to a probability distribution" = "We first model the response variable using a probability distribution"
- "Second, we... model's predictors." = "Second, we model the parameter of the distribution using the model's predictors and a special form of multiple regression."
- "Our focus will be... logistic regression." = ""
- "coded as variables" = "coded as predictor variables"


8.4.1 Email data
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- "We actually collected ... model for classifying spam" = "In fact, there are many more variables available that might be useful for classifying spam."
- "numerical predictors may be used" = "numerical predictors may also be used"
- in foot note: "This was the motivation for omitting" = "This is the motivation for omitting"
- "Each of those variables included in the data set passed" = "Each of the variables included in the expanded email data set passed"


8.4.2 Modeling the probability of an event
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- "using $x_{1,i}$ is the value of the first variable for observation $i$,  ... $i$, and so on" = "$x_{1,i}$ is the value of variable 1 for observation $i$, $x_{2,i}$ is the value of variable 2 for observation $i$, and so on"
- "and the predictors" = "to the predictors"
- "transformatio*" in 8.19 didn't render correctly in my copy
- "The transformation in Equation 8.19 is a particular ... [just before 'This model isn't very intuitive']" = "We want to choose a transformation in Equation 8.19 that makes practical and mathematical sense. For example, we certainly want a transformation that makes the range of possibilities on the left hand side of 8.19 equal to the range of possibilities for the right hand side; at the moment, the left hand side must be either 0 or 1, but the right hand side could be many other positive integers. A common transformation for $p_i$ is the logit transformation, which may be written as
\begin{}
logit function
\end{}
An example is shown in Figure 8.14. Below, we rewrite Equation 8.19 using the logit transformation of $p_i$
\begin{}
mean function
\end{}
In our spam example, there are 10 predictor variables, so $k = 10$."
- "resemblance of multiple regression" = "resemblance to multiple regression"
- "be summarized in a summary table" = "presented in a summary table"
- "This table structure is almost identical to that of multiple regression" = "The structure of this table is almost identical to that used in multiple regression"
- in caption to Table 8.15 "for the spam filter model." = "for the spam filter example."
- "generally will change" = "will generally change"


8.4.3 Inference for the email application
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- "Inference for the email application" = "Practical decisions in the email application"
- It doesn't seem necessary to attach specific probability values to the 1.2.3. list. It may also tempt students into attaching some special meaning to the values
- paragraph "The first and second scenarios.. go to the spambox." might work better abbreviated and formed as an Exercise


8.4.4 Diagnostics for the email classifier
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- "The model relating.. the truth." = "Our model relating the parameter $p_i$ to the predictors $X_1, .., X_k$ closely resembles the true relationship between the parameter and the predictors."
- "of the others." = "of the other outcomes."
- "we've got" = "we have"
- "But we should not" = "However, we should not"
- In Figure 8.17, ylab = "Truth"


8.4.5 Improving the set of variables for a spam filter
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- "thinking about data collection and other variables" = "thinking about additional variables"
- "in spam classification." = "in classifying emails as spam or not."
- ", and we could even use.. the spam filter." = ""
- Items (1) (2) and (3) (and sentences therein) should start with the same part of speech. e.g. (1) represent (2) utilize (3) examine
- "and then John later sent" = "and then John sent"
- "If you hadn't previously sent" = "If you had never sent"
- "to give a pass to what are verily likely non-spam messages." = "to capitalize on the fact that writers rarely send spam to their acquaintances."
- "and send those messages to the spambox." = ""
- "verify each of the variables is effective using data, these" = "verify, using the data, that each of the variables is effective, these"
- ", in effect waving.. to the inbox."
- "to wave about 28" = "to send about 28"
- "with much confidence" = "with confidence"
- "However, we'll save the details" = "We'll save the details"
- "the monumental task" = "the extremely challenging task"
- "appearance of certain words" = "inclusion of certain words"
- "However, we have.. classify future incoming email." = ""
- "logistic regression and carrying out the necessary" = "logistic regression to carrying out the necessary"
- "but the completing such a task is within your" = "but completing such a task is very nearly within your"
